Simon Pepin Lehalleur (that would be me) has just moved to Berlin, and is currently looking for opportunities to work as a Data scientist!

Here is a [CV]({{ site.url}}/resources/cv_ind.pdf) and a [picture]({{site_url}}/resources/img/profile.png).

In previous years, I have completed a PhD in mathematics in Algebraic geometry in [ZÃ¼rich](http://www.math.uzh.ch/) under the great guidance of [Joseph Ayoub](http://user.math.uzh.ch/ayoub/). More about this [here]({{site_url}}/research).
