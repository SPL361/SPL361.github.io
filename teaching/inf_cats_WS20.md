### Course overview

Category theory is a wonderful tool to understand mathematical structures. Since its origins in algebraic topology in the 1940's, it has become a unifying language for many fields of mathematics. A category records the relations between mathematical objects by specifying the morphisms between them.

There are nevertheless interesting mathematical phenomena (for instance in algebraic topology, homological algebra, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical physics, etc.) which category theory does not capture well. The basic problem, which has been understood almost since the beginning of category theory, is that we often need to record finer relationships between morphisms than just equality. A central example of such a finer relation is homotopy between continuous maps of topological spaces (or morphisms of chain complexes).

Infinity-category theory is a modern solution to this old problem. Roughly speaking, in an infinity-category, there is a space of morphisms between any two objects, considered up to coherent homotopy. The theory provides a framework which unifies classical category theory, homotopy theory and homological algebra, and which has already found many applications throughout mathematics.

This course will explain the basic theory of infinity-categories, following an approach based on simplicial sets developed by Andr√© Joyal and Jacob Lurie. The main point is that almost all the fundamental constructions of category theory ( limits and colimits, adjoint functors, representable functors and the Yoneda lemma, etc.) can be adapted to infinity-categories.

Recommended prior knowledge: Category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, representable functors, Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits, adjoint functors. Basic algebraic topology (as in the Master Math course Algebraic Topology I).
