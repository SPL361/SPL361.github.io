In my PhD work, under the supervision of [Joseph Ayoub](http://user.math.uzh.ch/ayoub/), I introduced and studied *motives of smooth commutative group schemes* and a new *motivic t-structure* on the *triangulated category of mixed 1-motives* over a general base scheme.

#### Papers:

* Subgroups of maximal rank of reductive groups, Panoramas et Synth√®ses 47, 2015, p.147-172

* (with G. Ancona and A. Huber) [On the relative motive of a smooth commutative group scheme](http://algebraicgeometry.nl/2016-2/2016-2-008.pdf), Algebraic Geometry, volume 3 issue 2, 2016, p.150-178
