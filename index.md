I am a mathematician, working on questions in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. 

My main interests are related to the theory of motivic and motivic homotopy theory: I am particularly interested in *motives of moduli spaces*, *motivic sheaves and the six-functor formalism*, *refined enumerative geometry* and *exponential motives*.

Starting from January 2023, I will be a post-doctoral research at [Korteweg-de Vries Institute](https://kdvi.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, in the research group of [Lenny Taelman](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/l.d.j.taelman/)

Since January 2020, I have been a post-doctoral researcher at the Radboud University Nijmegen (Netherlands). I am part of the Research group of [Ben Moonen](https://www.math.ru.nl/~bmoonen/).

Till the end of 2019, I was working in the [Arithmetic Geometry](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/arithmetic_geometry/index.html) Research group of [Hélène Esnault](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/users/esnault/) at the Freie Universität Berlin (Germany).
