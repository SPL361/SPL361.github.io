Conferences:

* I am coorganising an informal workshop on ["Machine learning, singularity theory and phase transitions"](https://simon-pepin.github.io/organisation/singular_learning_theory_sep23.html) on September 18th-21st at the University of Amsterdam.

* I coorganised three conferences in the summer 2023 in Nijmegen.

 [Motivic and non-commutative aspects of enumerative geometry](https://www.math.ru.nl/mnc-conference/) (July 3-5)

 [Homotopy theory, K-theory, and trace methods](https://www.math.ru.nl/hkt-conference/) (July 5-7)

 [Motives in moduli and representation theory](https://indico.imapp.ru.nl/event/124/) (July 10-14)


* On September 24-28, 2018, I have organised an Arbeitsgemeinschaft on "Motives, foliations and the conservativity conjecture" together with Joseph Ayoub and Bruno Klingler.

* On August 28-September 1, 2017, I have organised a summer school on [Motives for periods](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jfresan/berlin.html) together with Giuseppe Ancona and Javier Fresan.

Seminars:

* In the winter semester 2019-2020, I have organised a research seminar on the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces at Radboud University Nijmegen and the University of Amsterdam.

* In the spring semester 2016, I have organised a research seminar on ``Motivic Galois groups and periods'' at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.
