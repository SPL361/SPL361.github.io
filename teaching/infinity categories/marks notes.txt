Danijela. 1.0 / 1.3

Couldn't have done a better job myself. (Literally. She more or less copied my email on to the board).

Kristian. 2.3 / 2.7

+ very weak student, and my outline was not very clear.
+ wrote clearly, kept in time.
- couldn't answer any questions.
- just copied my notes on to the board, 

Arne.

Robert. 1.0

+ very good understanding of the material
+ said a lot of things orally, only writing key points on the board, so ook if listening, but not ok to read. otoh very detailed notes
+ great review of last week
classical categorigal motivation was maybe a little technical, to the point of being a little unclear
everyone seemed to follow ok

Karl. 1.0

+ clear presentation of material. 
+ covered everything required, i.e., good time management
+ clear writing
+ added an extra interesting remark (inner fibration = all fibres are âˆž-categories)
- left out how to get a functor from each edge in a coCartesian fibration
- bit of a lack of the global picture (but I didn't meet with him beforehand, and most speakers have this -)

Vincent. 1.0

+ good time management
+ clear writing if a little small
+ added a proof at the beginning
+ very careful
- missed some material I would have liked to have in, but whatever.
