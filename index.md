I am a mathematician, working on questions in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. 

My main interests are motives and motivic homotopy theory, algebraic groups, moduli spaces of bundles and the emerging field of exponential cohomology theories and exponential motives.

From January 2020, I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Radboud University Nijmegen (Netherlands). I am part of the Research group of [Ben Moonen](https://www.math.ru.nl/~bmoonen/).

Till the end of 2019, I was working in the [Arithmetic Geometry](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/arithmetic_geometry/index.html) Research group of [Hélène Esnault](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/users/esnault/) at the Freie Universität Berlin (Germany).
