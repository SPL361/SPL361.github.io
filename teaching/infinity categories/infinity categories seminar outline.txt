Need to put acyclic fibrations in somewhere. So need homotopy groups, and homotopy weak equivalences.

last four lectures options:

seifert-van kampen theorem
topoi

dold-kan? HA as main theorem?

Brown representability [HA]?
algebras, operads, HA
constructible sheaves HA
calculus of functors HA


Define the category $Fin_*$, [HA, Not.2.0.0.2]. %
Define inert morphisms in $Fin_*$, [HA, Def.2.1.1.8]. %
Define ∞-operad [HA, Def.2.1.1.10]. %
Define the underlying ∞-category of an ∞-operad [HA, Rem.2.1.1.12]. %

applications(?) of infinity categories
- generalisation of the gluing groupoids theorem
- spectra are easier?
- covering spaces correspond to quotients of the fundamental group, generalisation?
- moduli spaces
- dg categories, dag
