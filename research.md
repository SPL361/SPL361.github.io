In my PhD, I introduced and studied *motives of smooth commutative group schemes* and a new *motivic t-structure* on the *triangulated category of mixed 1-motives* over a general base scheme. I am currently developping applications of this category to various questions in arithmetic geometry.

More recently, I am studying the geometry and motives of moduli spaces and stacks of bundles, and exploring the emerging theory of exponential motives.
