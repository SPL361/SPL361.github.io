I am a mathematician, working on questions in algebraic and arithmetic geometry, in particular related to motives.

I am currently a post-doctoral student in the Research group in [Arithmetic Geometry](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/arithmetic_geometry/index.html) at the Freie Universität Berlin, under the joint supervision of Professor [Esnault](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/users/esnault/) and Professor [Srinivas](http://www.math.tifr.res.in/~srinivas/) (currently Einstein visiting fellow at the FU). I was previously a Phd student at the [University of Zürich](http://www.math.uzh.ch/).
